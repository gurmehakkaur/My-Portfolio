                    <h3>Project 1: Delivery Company Simulator</h3>
                    <p>I developed an intelligent routing system for a local delivery company operating within a city. This system optimizes routes for three delivery trucks, ensuring efficient package deliveries while considering truck capacity limits. It calculates the shortest paths avoiding obstacles, and assigns packages to the truck that requires the least deviation from its route. The system also balances loads by comparing available weight and volume capacity, ensuring optimal resource utilization. If no truck can accommodate a package, it's stored for next-day delivery.</p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Patient Appointment Booking App</h3>
                    <p>This project simulates an app for a local veterinary clinic. It has all the functions required to edit and view a clinic database. It lets you manage patients as you can- View, search, add, edit and remove a patient record. Similarly, you can add and remove appointments, and can view them, even filtering by date. The data is stored in a comma-separated file. This project mainly uses structures, file input/output operations and pointers. The project is focused on modular programming, and each module is designed to be cohesive and loosely coupled with others.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3: TeachMe Educational Platform</h3>
                    <p>This DBMS project focused on designing and building a comprehensive backend database for an educational platform that supports user management, course catalog, student enrollments, instructors' data, assessments (tests and scores), advertisements, and certifications. This model clearly defines each table and its relationship with other tables, to provide an effective Entity Relationship model. Business Rules for each relationship are clearly defined as well.</p>

                    <h3>Project 4: My Portfolio Website</h3>
                    <p>This website itself is no less than a project, because it has been purely designed and built by me. The main part of this website is that it showcases real-time stats from my Github account and Youtube channel. I connected my Github using fetchGitHubStats() which requested data from my gitHub and the response was used by innerHtml. Connecting Youtube was a bit complicated as I had to first generate API key in order to fetch real-time data from Youtube.</p>
