            <h3>Project 1: Delivery Company Simulator</h3>
            <p>I developed an intelligent routing system for a local delivery company operating within a city. This system 
                optimizes routes for three delivery trucks, ensuring efficient package deliveries while considering truck capacity limits.
                It calculates the shortest paths avoiding obstacles, and assigns 
                packages to the truck that requires the least deviation from its route. The system also balances loads by comparing available 
                weight and volume capacity, ensuring optimal resource utilization. If no truck can accommodate a package, it's stored for 
                next-day delivery.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Patient Appointment Booking App</h3>
            <p>This project simulates an app for a local vertenary clinic. It has all the functions required to edit and view a clinic database.
                It lets you manage patients as you can- View, search, add, edit and remove a patient record. Similarly, you can add and remove
                appointments, and can view them, even filtering by date. The data is stored in a comma-seperated file. 
                This project mainly uses structures, file input/output operations and pointers. The project is foccussed on modular programming, 
                and each module is designed to be cohesive and loosely coupled with others.

            <h3>Project 3: TeachMe Educational Platform</h3>
            <p>This DBMS project foccussed on designing and building a comprehensive backend database for an educational platform 
                that supports user management, course catalog, student enrollments, instructors' data, assessments (tests and scores), 
                advertisements, and 
                certifications. This model clearly defines each table and its relationship with other tables, to provide an effective 
                Entity Relatioship model. Business Rules for each relationship are clearly defined as well.</p>
